\begin{ethics}
This statement outlines the ethical considerations for this project, structured around the following principles: Avoidance of Harm, Informed Consent, and Data Protection.

\subsection*{Avoidance of Harm}
This project aims to explore technology that mitigates the potential harms \ac{AI}-generated images can cause. By enabling robust watermarking, this work helps combat misinformation (e.g., deepfakes), provides a mechanism for artists to receive attribution for their work, and aligns with regulatory demands for transparency in synthetically generated media, such as the European Union \ac{AI} Act \cite{RegulationEU20242024}.

Potential risks have been considered and mitigated. The risk of malicious actors reverse engineering the watermark is addressed by focusing on robustness evaluation rather than vulnerability exploitation. The potential for misuse regarding privacy/surveilance is acknowledged; however, the project's scope is strictly limited to authenticity and attribution, not tracking individuals.

\subsection*{Informed Consent}
This project does not involve human participants. All experiments are conducted using publicly available datasets and open-source software, adhering to their respective licensing terms (e.g., Creative Commons for MS-COCO \cite{linMicrosoftCOCOCommon2015}, MIT License for Gaussian Shading source code \cite{__fubar__BsmhmmlfGaussianShading2025}). The research ensures transparency and reproducibility by documenting all methodologies and making evaluation scripts available.

\subsection*{Data Protection}
No personal or sensitive data was collected, processed, or stored. The datasets used (MS-COCO and Gustavosta prompts \cite{GustavostaStableDiffusionPromptsDatasets2023}) are publicly available for research and contain no personally identifiable information. All generated images and research data will only be retained as long as necessary to ensure reproducibility. The project adheres to responsible research practices, including minimising computational resources to reduce environmental impact.

Based on these considerations, formal ethical approval from the Physical Sciences Ethics Committee (PSEC) was not required. All ethical aspects have been discussed with the project supervisor, and the completed ethics checklist is available in Appendix \ref{app:EthicsChecklist}.

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:Introduction}
\section{Motivation and Problem Statement}
The proliferation of powerful \acp{GAIM} such as Stable Diffusion \cite{rombachHighResolutionImageSynthesis2022}, DALL-E \cite{rameshZeroShotTexttoImageGeneration2021}, and Midjourney marks a significant technological leap, unlocking new possibilities in fields like content creation, design prototyping, and automation. However, the ease with which these models can generate highly realistic synthetic media introduces critical, ethical and practical challenges, including the spread of misinformation \cite{ferraraGenAIHumanityNefarious2024}, copyright infringement, and a general erosion of trust in digital content. Furthermore, current rulings by the United States Copyright Office render purely \ac{AI}-generated images ineligible for copyright protection \cite{CopyrightRegistrationGuidance2023}.

In response, a clear consensus is forming around the need for establishing authenticity, attribution, and traceability mechanisms for synthetic media. Governmental bodies, including the White House through its 2023 Executive Order on \ac{AI} \cite{houseExecutiveOrderSafe2023} and the European Union via its 2024 AI Act \cite{RegulationEU20242024}, have mandated the use of techniques like invisible watermarking for synthetic content. Consequently, leading technology companies have begun integrating such solutions; notable examples include Google's SynthID \cite{IdentifyingAIgeneratedImages2024}, Microsoft's watermarking in Bing Image Creator \cite{BingPreviewRelease2023}, and Stability \ac{AI}'s watermarking methods for its models \cite{CompVisStablediffusion2024}.

The urgency for effective watermarking is further underscored by concerns surrounding the data used to train \acp{GAIM}. Artists have voiced concerns about the unauthorised use of their work \cite{ThousandsArtistsCondemn2024}, leading to \ac{AI}-generated images that mimic their unique styles without credit or compensation \cite{AndersenStabilityAI}. This has fuelled the development of defensive techniques like Glaze \cite{shanGlazeProtectingArtists2023} and Nightshade \cite{shanNightshadePromptSpecificPoisoning2024}, which disrupt model training \cite{kurakinAdversarialExamplesPhysical2017}, highlighting the creative community's demand for control. While digital watermarking has a long history \cite{coxDigitalWatermarking2001}, its application to generative \ac{AI} presents new challenges and requires solutions that are integrated directly into the generation process. This project addresses the critical need for such a method, one that is imperceptible, robust against manipulation, capable of carrying attribution data without degrading image quality, and integrated within the generation process itself.

\section{Project Aims \& Scope}
The primary aim of this project is to investigate and evaluate the integration of digital watermarking within \ac{AI} image generation models to address the critical issues of \textbf{authenticity, attribution, traceability, and copyright protection}. To this end, the project will conduct a thorough evaluation of the Gaussian Shading watermarking algorithm, a state of the art, training-free technique designed for \acp{LDM}.

To achieve this, the following objectives have been set:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To conduct a focused review of modern watermarking techniques to identify the current state of the art, justify the selection of Gaussian Shading, and its position within the landscape of digital watermarking.
    \item To implement the Gaussian Shading algorithm within a standard \ac{GAIM} framework, specifically Stable Diffusion v2.1.
    \item To design and execute a comprehensive evaluation framework to test the watermark's imperceptibility and its robustness against a suite of common digital attacks.
    \item To analyse the results, assessing the crucial trade-offs between robustness, imperceptibility, and data capacity, and compare against published benchmarks to critically assess the performance and viability of Gaussian Shading as a practical watermarking solution.
\end{enumerate}

This project seeks to answer the following research questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To what extent can the Gaussian Shading method provide robust watermarking against a standard set of digital attacks, including compression, noise, and geometric transformations?
    \item What is the trade-off between watermark robustness and image quality? Can the method's performance lossless claim be substantiated using distribution based metrics like \ac{FID} and \ac{CLIP} score?
    \item How does the performance of Gaussian Shading compare to other leading in-generation watermarking techniques.
\end{itemize}

The key contribution of this project is a rigorous and independent empirical evaluation of the Gaussian Shading watermarking method. By providing detailed performance data and a direct comparison to established benchmarks, this work offers valuable insights for the development of responsible and traceable \ac{AI} generated image generation systems.

\section{Dissertation Structure}
The remainder of this dissertation is organised as follows: Chapter 2 reviews the literature on generative models and watermarking, focusing on the state of the art techniques that lead to the selection of Gaussian Shading. Chapter 3 details the methodology, system architecture, and the specific framework used for implementation and evaluation. Chapter 4 presents the results of the empirical evaluation, analysing the imperceptibility and robustness of the implemented solution. Finally, Chapter 5 concludes the dissertation, summarising the findings in relation to the research questions, discussing the study's limitations, and potential directions for future work.


\chapter{Literature Review}
\label{cha:Literature Review}
\section{Background}

\subsection{Generative Models in AI Image Generation}
Generative images have revolutionised the \ac{AI} field by enabling the creation of new data that closely resembles the training data. The three primary generative models used in \ac{AI} image generation being: \acp{GAN}, \acp{VAE}, and \acp{DM}.

\subsubsection{Variational Autoencoders (\acp{VAE})}
\acp{VAE} were first defined in 2013 by Kingma et al. \cite{kingmaAutoEncodingVariationalBayes2022} and Rezende et al. \cite{rezendeStochasticBackpropagationApproximate2014}. \acp{VAE} are probabilistic generative models that learn a latent space representation of input data. They consist of an encoder and a decoder, which work together to reconstruct input data from a compressed latent space. Watermarking in \acp{VAE} could involve perturbing latent space to insert information \cite{guoFreqMarkInvisibleImage2024}.

\subsubsection{Generative Adversarial Networks}
\acp{GAN}, proposed by Goodfellow et al. \cite{goodfellowGenerativeAdversarialNetworks2014} in 2014. \acp{GAN} consist of two neural networks: A generator, and a discriminator. The generator takes an input of random noise and generates an image by reassembling the real data distribution; The discriminator seeks to differentiate between real and generated images. The competing nature of the model helps in improving the quality of images generated over time. However, images generated are sensitive to perturbations \cite{alfarraRobustnessQualityMeasures2022}. Therefore, adding a watermark could degrade the quality of the image.

\subsubsection{Diffusion Models}
\acp{DM} were first introduced in 2015 by Sohl-Dickstein et al. \cite{sohl-dicksteinDeepUnsupervisedLearning2015} and popularised in 2020 by Ho et al. \cite{hoDenoisingDiffusionProbabilistic2020}. Unlike \acp{GAN} and \acp{VAE}, \acp{DM} generate images by iteratively denoising a random noise pattern, producing high quality images with fine details. The challenge in watermarking \acp{DM} lies in ensuring the watermark does not interfere with the denoising process in order to preserve image quality. \acp{LDM} such as Stable Diffusion, extend the concept of diffusion by performing the denoising process in a latent space rather than directly in pixel space, allowing for more efficient training and inference, as well as improved image quality \cite{rombachHighResolutionImageSynthesis2022}. In \acp{LDM}, a \ac{VAE} is used to compress the image to into a lower-dimensional latent space, which is then denoised iteratively to generate the final image.

\subsection{Applications and Motivations for Watermarking in the AI Era}
The rise of \acp{GAIM} has created an urgent need for robust watermarking solutions to address several key challenges.

\subsubsection{Preventing Training Data Contamination and Model Collapse}
Many \acp{GAIM} are trained on large datasets scraped from the internet. A significant risk in this process is "model collapse", where models are inadvertently trained on their own synthetic outputs or those from other models. This can lead to a feedback loop that degrades the quality and diversity of generated content over time \cite{bohacekNepotisticallyTrainedGenerativeAI2023}. Watermarking \ac{AI} generated images can mitigate this by marking these synthetic outputs, allowing them to be filtered out of future training datasets, thereby preserving the integrity of the training data.

\subsubsection{Attribution, Traceability, and Content Authenticity}
Watermarks can act as digital fingerprints for \ac{AI} generated images, enabling robust attribution and traceability. Depending on the implementation, a watermark could encode information about the originating model, the user, or the time of generation. This is vital for accountability, particularly when addressing the use of copyrighted material in training data or the distribution of malicious content. Initiatives like the \ac{C2PA}, backed by major technology firms, aim to standardise how this provenance information is embedded and read, creating a framework for digital content certification \cite{ContentCredentialsC2PA}. An effective watermarking scheme is therefore essential for copyright protection, verifying ownership, and ensuring the authenticity of digital media in an age of prolific \ac{AI} generation \cite{jiangWatermarkbasedDetectionAttribution2024}.

\section{Digital Watermarking Techniques}
\subsection{Traditional Spatial Domain Watermarking}
Spatial domain watermarking involves embedding watermarks directly into the pixel values. These methods are straightforward, easy to implement, and computationally efficient. However, are typically less resistant to attacks such as compression and transformations.

\subsubsection{Least Significant Bit (\ac{LSB}) Modification}
A common technique to embed a watermark information into randomly chosen pixels' \ac{LSB}. The \ac{LSB} is changed as to not affect the image quality as it contains less important information. However, it is trivial for an attacker to change all \ac{LSB} bits to 1 to modify the watermark. To address the problems with \ac{LSB} watermarking, improvements have been made. One such improvement embeds data not only to the \ac{LSB} but also higher planes. Moreover, a 2-3-3 embedding technique \cite{manjulaNovelHashBased2015} distributes the watermark across the \ac{RGB} channels of a pixel. This approach results in minimal perceptual distortion while achieving better embedding capacity and robustness.

\subsubsection{Patch-based or Block-Based techniques}
Proposed by Bender et al. \cite{benderTechniquesDataHiding1996} This method involves randomly picking $n$ pairs of image points $A,B$ where the image data in $A$ is darkened, while is brightened in $B$. This method offers decent robustness in exchange for capacity. \cite{saqibSpatialFrequencyDomain2017}

\subsection{Traditional Frequency (Transform) Domain Watermarking}
These techniques embed watermark information within the frequency domain of an image after a transformation. This approach spreads the watermark information throughout the image in ways that are less perceptible to the human eye and more resilient to common attacks compared to spatial methods.

\subsubsection{Discrete Cosine Transform}
\ac{DCT} watermarking embeds watermark information into an images frequency coefficients after transforming it from the spatial to the frequency domain. This leverages energy compaction, where the majority of an image's visual information is represented by lower-frequency coefficients, while higher-frequency coefficients capture finer image details. A common approach is block-based \ac{DCT}, where the image is divided into smaller non-overlapping blocks, \ac{DCT} is then applied to each block. Mid-frequency coefficients are typically chosen, balancing imperceptibility and robustness. Modifying low-frequency coefficients can lead to more noticeable distortions, while high-frequency coefficients are more susceptible to compression and noise attacks. Block-based \ac{DCT} is particularly suitable for \ac{JPEG} compression, a prevalent image compression technique which is also block-based \cite{wallaceJPEGStillPicture1991}. By embedding watermarks in \ac{DCT} coefficients compatible with \ac{JPEG}'s compression algorithm, the watermark can survive compression without significant degradation \cite{borsImageWatermarkingUsing1996}. Alternatively, global \ac{DCT} applies the transformation to the entire image rather than individual blocks. This offers greater robustness against attacks, but is more computationally intensive and less compatible with block-based compression techniques such as \ac{JPEG}.

The robustness of \ac{DCT}-based watermarking comes from the ability to embed data in perceptually significant regions of an image, therefore being less likely to be removed by common image processing operations. However, \ac{DCT} based watermarking methods struggle with maintaining robustness against geometric attacks such as scaling and rotation due to inherently not accounting for spatial transformations \cite{fazliRobustImageWatermarking2016}. From this hybrid techniques combining \ac{DCT} with other transformations have arisen \cite{abdulrahmanNovelHybridDCT2019}.

\subsubsection{Discrete Fourier Transform}
Similar to \ac{DCT} watermarking, \ac{DFT} embeds watermark information into an images frequency domain by transforming it from the spatial domain to the frequency domain, but using the \ac{DFT} which decomposes an image into sinusoidal components of varying frequencies, represented as complex-valued coefficients corresponding to magnitude and phase. These coefficients describe the global frequency characteristics of the image, making \ac{DFT}-based watermarking inherently robust against various image processing operations and certain geometric transformations.

\ac{LPM} transforms the image into log-polar coordinates before applying \ac{DFT}. This mapping converts scaling and rotation into linear translations in the frequency domain, enabling efficient watermark extraction after significant geometric transformations \cite{zhengRSTinvariantDigitalImage2003}.

\subsubsection{Discrete Wavelet Transform}
A \ac{DWT} is any wavelet transform that decomposes a signal into wavelets, offering local analysis in both the time and frequency domains. Unlike \ac{DFT}, which analyses global frequency count, and \ac{DCT} which can operate globally or block-based, \ac{DWT} inherently supports multi-resolution analysis by examining signals at different scales. This dual localisation makes \ac{DWT} particularly effective for image watermarking, as it can capture coarse and fine image details simultaneously.

\subsubsection{Applications to AI-Generated Images}
Traditional frequency domain methods (DCT, DWT) represent conventional image watermarking approaches that operate in the frequency domain. While well-established and widely used for natural images, these techniques are generic post-processing methods that don't specifically leverage the properties of the AI generation processes. Their application remains relatively unexplored in recent LDM-specific literature compared to direct latent modification approaches that are purposefully designed for AI-generated content.

\subsection{Post-Generation Methods}
Methods like HiDDeN \cite{zhuHiDDeNHidingData2018} and FreqMark \cite{guoFreqMarkInvisibleImage2024} demonstrate impressive results, they are designed as post-generation solutions that can be applied to any image, regardless of its source. This makes them less specifically tailored to the unique characteristics and requirements of AI-generated content.
\subsubsection{HiDDeN}
One promising advancement in watermarking is the HiDDeN framework \cite{zhuHiDDeNHidingData2018}. HiDDeN leverages the sensitivity of deep neural networks to small perturbations in input images to encode information, making it a robust solution for watermarking.

The HiDDeN framework comprises three main components: an encoder, a decoder, and an adversary network. The encoder receives an image and a message string, outputting an encoded image that incorporates the watermark. The decoder attempts to reconstruct the original message from the encoded image, while the adversary network predicts whether a given image contains an encoded watermark, providing adversarial loss to enhance the quality of the encoded images.

The adversarial training enhances the watermark's resilience against numerous attacks. The deep leaning approach allows for a more flexible watermark embedding,

\subsection{Modern Watermarking for AI-Generated Images}
Recent advancements have focused on integrating watermarks directly into the generative process of \acp{DM} and \acp{LDM}, offering greater robustness and imperceptibility compared to traditional post-processing methods.

\subsubsection{Tree-Ring}
Tree-Ring \cite{wenTreeRingsWatermarksInvisible2023} is a notable in-generation technique for \acp{DM}. It operates by embedding a watermark signal into the initial noise vector ($z_{T}$) before the diffusion process begins. The core idea is that the deterministic nature of \ac{DDIM} inversion allows for the retrieval of the initial noise vector from the final generated image. By comparing the recovered noise with the known watermark signal, the presence of the watermark can be detected. While effective for detection, its original design is primarily for a 1-bit watermark, which limits its viability for use other than binary watermark detection.

\subsubsection{Stable Signature}
Stable Signature \cite{fernandezStableSignatureRooting2023b} is a watermarking approach designed specifically for \acp{LDM}. Instead of modifying the initial noise, this method fine-tunes the model's autoencoder (\ac{VAE}). The \ac{VAE}'s decoder is trained to embed a specific watermark pattern into the generated image's pixel space while the encoder is trained to be robust to its presence. By embedding the watermark directly into the model's architecture, Stable Signature aims to create a watermark that is deeply integrated with the image's content and thus more resilient to post-processing attacks.

\subsubsection{Gaussian Shading}
Gaussian Shading \cite{yangGaussianShadingProvable2024} is a training-free, performance-lossless watermarking technique for \acp{LDM}. Unlike methods that require model fine-tuning, Gaussian Shading is a plug-and-play solution that modifies the initial latent sampling step. The watermark is mapped to a latent representation that follows a standard Gaussian distribution, making it statistically indistinguishable from a non-watermarked latent vector. This ensures that the watermarking process does not degrade the performance of the generative model. The watermark is embedded by diffusing the bits across the latent dimensions and then using a distribution-preserving sampling method. Extraction is achieved through \ac{DDIM} inversion to retrieve an estimate of the initial latent, from which the watermark can be recovered. The authors provide theoretical proof of its performance-lossless nature and demonstrate high robustness against common attacks, outperforming many existing methods.

\subsubsection{Comparative Analysis}
To provide a clear overview, Table \ref{tab:watermarking_comparison} compares the different watermarking techniques discussed.

\section{Watermarking Optimisations and Enhancements}
\subsection{Perceptual Masking}
Perceptual masking exploits the characteristics of human vision by embedding watermarks into regions of an image where the changes will be less noticeable. For example, areas with high texture or edges rather than flat or uniform areas.

\section{Watermarking Challenges and Evaluation}
A successful watermarking scheme must be robust against a variety of attacks designed to remove or degrade the embedded information. Furthermore, its performance must be quantifiable using standard evaluation metrics.

\subsection{Attacks on Watermarks}
Watermarks are susceptible to a wide range of attacks, which can be broadly categorised as follows:
\textbf{Removal Attacks:} These are designed to completely eliminate the watermark signal from the image. This can include denoising filters or adversarial attacks specifically trained to target and erase the watermark.
\textbf{Geometric Attacks:} These attacks alter the geometry of the image, which can desynchronise the detector. Common examples include rotation, scaling, cropping, and translation.
\textbf{Signal Processing Attacks:} These are common image manipulations that can unintentionally degrade or destroy the watermark. This category includes lossy compression (e.g., \ac{JPEG}), noise addition (e.g., Gaussian noise), and filtering (e.g., blurring).

A robust watermarking system must be able to withstand a combination of these attacks to be considered effective in real-world scenarios.

\subsection{Metrics for Evaluation}
To objectively assess the performance of a watermarking technique, a set of standard metrics is used to measure three key properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Imperceptibility:} This measures the visual distortion introduced by the watermark. For traditional watermarking methods, commonly quantified using pixel level metrics like \ac{PSNR} and \ac{SSIM}. However, for latent space watermarking methods like Gaussian Shading, distribution-based metrics such as \ac{FID} and \ac{CLIP} Score are more appropriate. Lower \ac{FID} values mean the distribution of watermarked images is closer to that of the original images, while similar \ac{CLIP} scores indicate that the semantic content of the images remain consistent with the original prompts.
    \item \textbf{Robustness:} This is a measure of the watermark's ability to survive attacks. Typically evaluated by calculating the \ac{BER} between the original and extracted watermark message after an attack has been applied. A lower \ac{BER} indicates better robustness.
    \item \textbf{Capacity:} This refers to the amount of information (in bits) that can be embedded within the watermark. There is often a trade-off between capacity, robustness, and imperceptibility.
\end{itemize}
These metrics provide the foundation for the experimental evaluation framework described in the next chapter.

\chapter{Methodology}
\label{cha:Methodology}

This chapter details the approach taken to investigate, implement, and evaluate the Gaussian Shading watermarking technique for \ac{AI} generated images. It covers the research strategy, the selection of the specific watermarking technique from available literature, a detailed experimental design, and the comprehensive framework for evaluation. The methodology will outline an assessment process that will enable comparison with state of the art techniques while operating within the feasibility constraints of an undergraduate project.

\section{Research Approach}
\label{sec:ResearchApproach}

This study employs a \textbf{quantitative empirical evaluation} methodology to assess the performance of Gaussian Shading watermarking. The approach is aligned with established benchmarks in the watermarking literature, specifically following the evaluation protocols used by Tree-Ring \cite{wenTreeRingsWatermarksInvisible2023} and Stable Signature \cite{fernandezStableSignatureRooting2023b}, enabling direct comparison without requiring re-implementation of competing methods.

The selection of \acp{LDM} as the primary architecture is justified by their current dominance in high quality image generation and the availability of open source implementations \cite{dhariwalDiffusionModelsBeat2021}. Specifically, Stable Diffusion \cite{rombachHighResolutionImageSynthesis2022} is chosen due to its open source nature \cite{CompVisStablediffusion2024}, widespread adoption in research, and existing watermarking literature within its framework \cite{fernandezStableSignatureRooting2023b, zhaoRecipeWatermarkingDiffusion2023a, zhangAttackResilientImageWatermarking2024}.

\section{Watermarking Technique Selection}
\label{sec:WatermarkingTechniqueSelection}

The primary goal is to embed imperceptible watermarks that facilitate traceability and attribution. Based on the literature review, several approaches are viable, particularly those designed for or adaptable to \acp{LDM}. Latent space modification techniques like Stable Signature \cite{fernandezStableSignatureRooting2023b}, Tree-Ring \cite{wenTreeRingsWatermarksInvisible2023}, LaWa \cite{rezaeiLaWaUsingLatent2024}, ZoDiac \cite{zhangAttackResilientImageWatermarking2024}, and WMAdapter \cite{ciWMAdapterAddingWaterMark2024} propose embedding the watermark within the latent space during the image generation process. This approach is specifically designed for AI image generation, as it integrates directly with the generative model's architecture and workflow.

The final selection of the watermarking technique is based on the following criteria:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Suitability for LDM Integration:} How readily the technique can be integrated into the Stable Diffusion architecture.
    \item \textbf{Robustness Potential:} Theoretical and empirical evidence from literature regarding resistance to common image manipulations.
    \item \textbf{Capacity for Attribution Data:} Ability to embed a sufficient payload for traceability purposes \cite{jiangWatermarkbasedDetectionAttribution2024}.
    \item \textbf{Imperceptibility:} Maintaining high visual quality of the generated images.
    \item \textbf{Implementation Feasibility:} Availability of reference implementations or clarity of the proposed algorithm within the project timeframe.
\end{enumerate}

Based on these criteria, Gaussian Shading \cite{yangGaussianShadingProvable2024} was selected. Its approach modifies the initial latent sampling process, offering direct integration (Criterion 1). A key advantage is its provably performance-lossless nature, meaning it does not require model fine-tuning and aims to preserve the original model's output quality (Criteria 1, 4, 5). The original paper reports high robustness and good capacity (Criteria 2 \& 3), making it a strong candidate. While other latent space methods like Stable Signature \cite{fernandezStableSignatureRooting2023b} or Tree-Ring \cite{wenTreeRingsWatermarksInvisible2023} (originally designed primarily for 1-bit capacity, limiting its suitability for detailed attribution data under Criterion 3) also offer strong integration, Gaussian Shading's advantage for this project lies with it being performance-lossless without needing model fine-tuning or architectural changes (Criterion 5). This simplifies implementation and ensures the watermark minimally impacts the generative capabilities of the base Stable Diffusion model (Criterion 4), compared to approaches that might require adjustments to the \ac{VAE} or U-Net.


\section{Experimental Design}
\label{sec:ExperimentalDesign}

\subsection{Standard Evaluation Protocol}
\label{subsec:StandardEvaluationProtocol}

To ensure reproducible and comparable results, the evaluation follows a standardised protocol:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Generative Model:} Stable Diffusion v2.1-base
    \item \textbf{Image Resolution:} 512$\times$512 pixels (standard for SD v2.1)
    \item \textbf{Guidance Scale:} 7.5 (classifier-free guidance strength)
    \item \textbf{Inference Steps:} 50 (using DPMSolver++ scheduler)
    \item \textbf{Precision:} Float16 for memory efficiency
    \item \textbf{Batch Size:} 1 (for reproducibility and memory constraints)
\end{itemize}

These parameters align with established benchmarks and ensure compatibility with the RTX 2070 Super GPU constraints (8GB \ac{VRAM}) while maintaining generation quality.

\subsection{Dataset Selection and Justification}
\label{subsec:DatasetSelection}

The evaluation employs a two-tier dataset strategy to balance comprehensive assessment with computational feasibility. The primary dataset for imperceptibility and baseline quality analysis is derived from the MS-COCO \cite{linMicrosoftCOCOCommon2015} 2017 validation set captions. From this, a subset of 1000 diverse prompts was curated to ensure a representative sample for calculating the \ac{FID} score, aligning with standard evaluation practices in the literature.

For the robustness evaluation, a different prompt set was created from the \texttt{Gustavosta/Stable-Diffusion-Prompts} \cite{GustavostaStableDiffusionPromptsDatasets2023} collection. This dataset is known for its diverse and challenging prompts. A subset of 200 prompts was selected to cover a wide range of categories, including portraits, landscapes, objects, and abstract concepts. This reduction to 200 prompts was a made to ensure the feasibility of executing the suite of 12 attack configurations on each generated image within the time and hardware constraints of the project, while still providing sufficient data for analysis.

\subsection{Watermark Configuration}
\label{subsec:WatermarkConfiguration}

The watermark implementation follows the Gaussian Shading specification with a 256-bit capacity. For empirical testing, the payload consists of random binary strings per generation to facilitate robust \ac{BER} analysis; in practice, this would contain attribution data (generation ID, model identifier, timestamp). The payload is then encrypted using a ChaCha20 stream cipher with random key/nonce per image before embedding. Standard diffusion parameters (\texttt{channel\_copy = 1}, \texttt{hw\_copy = 8}) are used as specified in \cite{yangGaussianShadingProvable2024}. The detection threshold targets an \ac{FPR} of $10^{-6}$ for statistical significance. Practically, deployment would also incorporate error correction codes (e.g., \ac{BCH} codes) before embedding to enhance robustness against channel noise and attacks.

\section{System Architecture}
\label{sec:SystemArchitecture}

The Gaussian Shading watermarking system operates through two primary pipelines: embedding and extraction. Figure \ref{fig:system_architecture} illustrates the complete architecture of the system, highlighting the key components and data flow.

\subsection{Embedding Pipeline}
The \textbf{embedding pipeline} integrates watermarking directly into the image generation process:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Text Encoding:} The process begins with a text prompt that is encoded using the \ac{CLIP} text encoder to produce conditioning vectors.
    
    \item \textbf{Watermark Preparation:} The watermark message $s$ (a binary string) is diffused across latent dimensions to obtain $s_{d}$, creating redundant copies for robustness. The diffused watermark $s_{d}$ is then encrypted with a ChaCha20 stream cipher using a secret key $K$ to produce $m$.
    
    \item \textbf{Distribution-Preserving Sampling:} The core innovation occurs during initial latent sampling. Instead of standard sampling $z_{T} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$, the method uses distribution-preserving sampling based on $m$ using a Gaussian quantile function and uniform random sampling. This ensures the watermarked latent maintains the same statistical properties as a non-watermarked latent.
    
    \item \textbf{Denoising Process:} The watermarked latent $z_{T}$ undergoes standard 50-step diffusion denoising guided by the conditioning vectors.
    
    \item \textbf{Image Decoding:} Finally, the \ac{VAE} decoder transforms the denoised latent representation into the final watermarked image in pixel space.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Extraction Pipeline}
The \textbf{extraction pipeline} reverses the embedding process to recover the watermark:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Latent Encoding:} The watermarked image is encoded using the \ac{VAE} encoder to produce a latent representation $z_{0}'$.
    
    \item \textbf{\ac{DDIM} Inversion:} A deterministic \ac{DDIM} inversion process with 50 steps is applied to estimate the initial noise $z_{T}'$ that would have generated the image.
    
    \item \textbf{Watermark Recovery:} Inverse sampling logic (Gaussian \ac{CDF}) extracts a randomized watermark estimate $m'$ from $z_{T}'$, which is decrypted with key $K$ to recover the diffused watermark estimate $s_{d}'$.
    
    \item \textbf{Bit Reconstruction:} A reduction/voting mechanism across the diffused copies recovers the final watermark estimate $s'$, enabling binary classification between watermarked and non-watermarked images based on the recovered bits.
\end{enumerate}

The architecture is designed to be modular, allowing for adjustments to parameters such as the number of diffusion steps, watermark length, and diffusion redundancy factors without requiring structural changes.

    \label{fig:system_architecture}
\end{figure}

\section{Implementation Details}
\label{sec:ImplementationDetails}

\subsection{Technical Environment}
\label{subsec:TechnicalEnvironment}

The implementation utilises an NVIDIA RTX 2070 Super (8GB \ac{VRAM}) with \ac{CUDA} 11.7, running Python 3.8 with PyTorch 1.13+ and Diffusers 0.11.1. Key dependencies include transformers (4.21.0) for \ac{CLIP} text encoding, accelerate for memory optimisation, scipy for statistical functions, and pycryptodome for ChaCha20 cryptographic operations. The 8GB \ac{VRAM} constraint necessitates memory efficiency strategies: float16 precision reduces memory footprint by 50\%, sequential processing prevents out-of-memory errors, and gradient checkpointing enables processing of 512×512 images. Memory allocation is optimised through PyTorch's attention implementation and careful tensor lifecycle management during \ac{DDIM} inversion.

\subsection{Gaussian Shading Implementation}
\label{subsec:GaussianShadingImplementation}

The implementation follows the algorithm specification from \cite{yangGaussianShadingProvable2024}, The method consists of three key components: watermark diffusion, distribution preserving sampling, and DDIM inversion for extraction.

\subsubsection{Watermark Diffusion}
The watermark message $s \in \{0,1\}^m$ undergoes an initial diffusion process across its latent dimensions to enhance robustness. This process generates multiple copies of each bit across different dimensions, defined as $s_{d} = \text{Diffuse}(s, \text{channel\_copy}, \text{hw\_copy})$. Where $\text{channel\_copy}$ determines how many copies are made across channel dimensions, and $\text{hw\_copy}$ controls copies across spatial dimensions. This redundancy is important for robustness, as it allows for majority voting during extraction even if some dimensions are corrupted by attacks. The diffused watermark $s_d$ is then encrypted using ChaCha20 stream cipher with a secret key $K$ to produce the encrypted watermark $m$: $m = \text{Encrypt}(s_d, K)$

\subsubsection{Distribution Preserving Sampling}
A key part of Gaussian Shading is the distribution preserving sampling technique. In standard diffusion models, the initial latent is sampled from a standard normal distribution:

\begin{equation}
z_{T} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I) \text{ (standard)}
\end{equation}

For watermarking, this sampling is modified to embed the encrypted watermark while maintaining the same statistical distribution:

\begin{equation}
z_{T}^{(w)} = \Phi^{-1}(U \cdot \Phi(z_{T}) + (1-U) \cdot \Phi(z_{T}^{(ref)})) \text{ (watermarked)}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Phi$ is the standard normal \ac{CDF}
    \item $\Phi^{-1}$ is the inverse \ac{CDF} (quantile function)
    \item $U$ is a uniform random variable in $[0,1]$
    \item $z_{T}^{(ref)}$ is a reference latent that encodes the encrypted watermark bits
\end{itemize}

This approach ensures that $z_{T}^{(w)}$ follows the same distribution as $z_{T}$, making the watermark statistically undetectable and preserving the generative model's performance. The implementation uses the error function (erf) and its inverse for efficient computation of the normal \ac{CDF} and quantile functions.

\subsubsection{\ac{DDIM} Inversion for Extraction}
The extraction process uses deterministic \ac{DDIM} inversion with 50 steps to estimate the initial latent. The algorithm is:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{\ac{DDIM} Inversion for Watermark Extraction}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE Watermarked image $x$, number of steps $T$
\ENSURE Estimated initial latent $\hat{z}_T$
\STATE $z_0 \gets \text{VAE\_Encoder}(x)$ \COMMENT{Encode image to latent space}
\FOR{$t = 1$ to $T$}
    \STATE $\epsilon_\theta \gets \text{U-Net}(z_{t-1}, t-1)$ \COMMENT{Predict noise}
    \STATE $z_t \gets \text{DDIM\_Step}(z_{t-1}, \epsilon_\theta, t-1, t)$ \COMMENT{Reverse diffusion step}
\ENDFOR
\RETURN $z_T$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Where $\text{DDIM\_Step}$ implements the deterministic reverse diffusion process according to the \ac{DDIM} formulation. Once the initial latent $\hat{z}_{T}$ is recovered, the watermark is extracted by applying the inverse of the distribution preserving sampling process: $\hat{m} = \text{Extract}(\hat{z}_{T}, K)$

The extracted watermark $\hat{m}$ is then decrypted and the diffused bits are combined through majority voting to recover the original message $\hat{s}$.

\subsubsection{Memory Optimization Techniques}
The implementation incorporates several memory optimization strategies to operate within the 8GB VRAM constraint:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Half-precision arithmetic:} All tensors use float16 precision, reducing memory footprint by half compared to float32.
    \item \textbf{Sequential processing:} Images are processed one at a time rather than in batches to avoid memory spikes.
    \item \textbf{Efficient tensor management:} Careful attention to tensor lifecycle, explicitly freeing unused tensors and using in-place operations where possible.
    \item \textbf{Optimised attention implementation:} Using PyTorch's attention implementation to reduce memory footprint of transformer blocks in the U-Net.
\end{itemize}

These optimisations enable processing of $512\times512$ images on the specified hardware without compromising the quality of the watermarking process.

\section{Evaluation Framework}
\label{sec:EvaluationFramework}

\subsection{Attack Suite Configuration}
\label{subsec:AttackSuiteConfiguration}

The robustness evaluation employs a comprehensive attack suite designed to test common image processing operations:

\begin{table}[htb]
\caption{Attack Configuration Parameters}
\label{tab:attack_parameters}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Attack Type} & \textbf{Parameters} & \textbf{Configurations} \\
\hline
\ac{JPEG} Compression & Quality Factor & 90, 75, 50, 25 \\
\hline
Gaussian Noise & Standard Deviation & 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 \\
\hline
Gaussian Blur & Kernel Radius & 2, 4 \\
\hline
Brightness Adjustment & Multiplication Factor & 0.5, 2.0 \\
\hline
Random Crop & Retention Ratio & 0.8 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

This configuration yields 12 attack scenarios, each evaluated on 200 images, totaling 2400 robustness experiments. The parameter ranges are selected to align with previous watermarking studies while covering mild to severe attack intensities.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
\label{subsec:EvaluationMetrics}

The evaluation framework employs three metric categories.

While traditional metrics like \ac{PSNR} and \ac{SSIM} are common for assessing imperceptibility, they are not the primary metrics for this evaluation. The Gaussian Shading technique operates by altering the initial latent sample ($z_T$). As such, even when using an the same seed, the watermarked and non-watermarked images are inherently distinct at the pixel level, as they are slightly modified versions of one another. Applying pixel level metrics in this context is not appropriate, as they would report significant differences that do not reflect perceptual similarity.

Therefore, distribution based metrics are more appropriate. The \ac{FID} score is used to compare the statistical distributions of the entire set of 1000 watermarked images against the 1000 non-watermarked images, providing a more meaningful measure of the watermark's overall impact on the model's output distribution. Additionally, the \ac{CLIP} score is used to ensure that the semantic content of the generated images remains consistent with the original prompt, further validating the watermark's imperceptibility.

\textbf{Imperceptibility metrics} \ac{FID} for distribution preservation, and \ac{CLIP} Score for semantic similarity between prompts and generated images. \textbf{Robustness metrics} comprise \ac{BER} as the primary robustness measure, \ac{TPR} for detection accuracy at fixed \ac{FPR}, and overall detection accuracy for binary classification performance.

\subsection{Comparative Analysis Strategy}
\label{subsec:ComparativeAnalysisStrategy}

Rather than implementing competing methods, the evaluation strategy employs \textbf{benchmark extraction} from published literature:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Literature Analysis:} Extract performance metrics from Tree-Ring \cite{wenTreeRingsWatermarksInvisible2023} and Stable Signature \cite{fernandezStableSignatureRooting2023b} papers.
    \item \textbf{Standardised Comparison:} Align evaluation datasets and attack parameters with published benchmarks.
    \item \textbf{Statistical Analysis:} Report confidence intervals and significance tests where applicable.
    \item \textbf{Performance Tables:} Create comparative tables showing relative performance across methods.
\end{enumerate}

This approach enables rigorous comparison while remaining feasible within project constraints.

\subsection{Statistical Rigor and Reproducibility}
\label{subsec:StatisticalRigor}

Scientific validity is ensured through deterministic random number generation with fixed seeds for reproducibility, statistically sufficient sample sizes (n=200 per attack, n=1000 for \ac{FID}), 95\% confidence intervals for key metrics, and comprehensive documentation of all code and hyperparameters under version control.

\subsection{Success Criteria and Thresholds}
\label{subsec:SuccessCriteria}

The evaluation sets a clear success criteria to assess Gaussian Shading's viability. \textbf{Imperceptibility thresholds} require \ac{FID} $<$ 5.0 (indicating minimal distribution shift between watermarked and non-watermarked images) and \ac{CLIP} Score difference $<$ 0.05 (indicating preservation of semantic content). \textbf{Robustness thresholds} require \ac{BER} $<$ 0.1 for mild attacks (\ac{JPEG} QF $\geq$ 75), \ac{BER} $<$ 0.25 for moderate attacks (\ac{JPEG} QF $\geq$ 50), and \ac{TPR} $>$ 0.9 at \ac{FPR} = $10^{-6}$. These derived thresholds from the literature provide objective criteria for evaluating the performance lossless claims of Gaussian Shading.

The methodology balances comprehensive evaluation with practical constraints, ensuring that results are both scientifically valid and directly comparable to existing literature while remaining achievable within undergraduate project scope and hardware limitations.


\chapter{Results and Analysis}
\label{cha:Results}

This chapter presents a comprehensive evaluation of the Gaussian Shading watermarking technique, examining both its imperceptibility and robustness characteristics through statistical analysis. The evaluation addresses the research questions concerning the viability of Gaussian Shading as a practical watermarking solution for \ac{AI}-generated images, and its place in the image watermarking landscape.

\section{Imperceptibility Analysis}
\label{sec:ImperceptibilityAnalysis}

The imperceptibility evaluation constitutes the foundational assessment of Gaussian Shading's main advantage: that watermarks can be embedded without degrading the quality or altering the statistical properties of generated images. This section presents an analysis using both semantic and distributional metrics to provide a comprehensive understanding of the watermark's impact.

\subsection{Visual and Semantic Preservation}
\label{subsec:VisualSemanticPreservation}

The qualitative assessment of imperceptibility requires careful consideration of the watermarking process. Figure \ref{fig:visual_comparison} demonstrates the range of high-quality images that can be generated using the Gaussian Shading watermarking framework across diverse categories including landscapes, urban scenes, food, and architectural subjects.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{assets/visual_comparison.pdf}
    \caption{Sample images generated using the Gaussian Shading watermarking framework across diverse categories. The framework maintains high visual quality across varied content types, from landscapes and cityscapes to food and architectural subjects.}
    \label{fig:visual_comparison}
\end{figure}

While direct visual comparison of identical seeds with and without watermarking would provide the most rigorous imperceptibility assessment, the consistent high quality of watermarked images across diverse content categories suggests that the method does not introduce systematic visual artifacts that would compromise image quality.

To quantify semantic preservation, the evaluation employs \ac{CLIP} scores, which measure the semantic alignment between text prompts and generated images. The results, presented in Table \ref{tab:semantic_metrics}, reveal remarkable semantic consistency. The negligible difference of 0.0008 between watermarked (0.3091) and non-watermarked (0.3099) image sets falls well within natural variation bounds and significantly exceeds the success threshold of 0.05. This quantitative validation confirms that the watermarking process preserves the semantic integrity of the generation process, ensuring that the resulting images remain faithful to their textual descriptions.

\begin{table}[htb]
    \caption{Semantic CLIP Analysis}
    \label{tab:semantic_metrics}
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Condition} & \textbf{Mean \ac{CLIP} Score} & \textbf{Difference} & \textbf{Assessment} \\ \hline
    Non-watermarked & 0.3099 & - & Baseline \\ \hline
    Watermarked & 0.3091 & -0.0008 & \textbf{Imperceptible} \\ \hline
    Success Threshold & - & < 0.05 & \textbf{Met} \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

The negligible difference in \ac{CLIP} scores (0.0008) demonstrates that the watermarking process preserves the semantic integrity of the generation process, ensuring that the resulting images remain faithful to their textual descriptions.

\subsection{Distributional Impact: A Critical Discovery}
\label{subsec:DistributionalImpact}

While the semantic and visual assessments strongly support the imperceptibility claims, the distributional analysis reveals a more complex reality. The \ac{FID} score, which measures the statistical distance between the distributions of watermarked and non-watermarked image sets, yields a value of 47.83—nearly an order of magnitude above the stringent success threshold of 5.0.

This finding represents a critical discovery that challenges the absolute nature of the "performance-lossless" claim. The elevated \ac{FID} score indicates that while individual images remain visually and semantically identical, the underlying statistical distribution of the watermarked image set has been measurably altered. This suggests that the watermarking process introduces systematic changes to the generative process that, while imperceptible at the individual image level, become detectable when analysing the aggregate behaviour of the model.

\begin{table}[htb]
    \caption{Distributional Impact Assessment}
    \label{tab:distributional_metrics}
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Observed Value} & \textbf{Success Threshold} & \textbf{Assessment} \\ \hline
    \ac{FID} Score & 47.83 & < 5.0 & \textbf{Significant Impact} \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Contextualising the FID Score}
The elevated \ac{FID} score requires careful interpretation within the broader context of generative model evaluation. Several factors may contribute to this result:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Sample Size Sensitivity:} \ac{FID} scores are known to be sensitive to sample size. This evaluation used 1,000 images compared to the original paper's 5,000 images, which may contribute to the elevated score through reduced statistical stability.
    
    \item \textbf{Distributional Shift vs. Quality Degradation:} The high \ac{FID} score may indicate a distributional shift rather than quality degradation. The watermarking process modifies the sampling mechanism, potentially altering the exploration of the latent space in ways that affect aggregate statistics without compromising individual image quality.
    
    \item \textbf{Methodological Differences:} Variations in the \ac{FID} calculation methodology, including the choice of feature extraction network and preprocessing steps, can significantly impact results.
\end{enumerate}

This analysis suggests that while Gaussian Shading achieves visual and semantic imperceptibility, it may not be entirely "performance-lossless" from a strict distributional perspective. This finding has important implications for applications where maintaining precise distributional properties is critical.

\section{Robustness Evaluation: Strengths and Critical Vulnerabilities}
\label{sec:RobustnessEvaluation}

The robustness assessment evaluates the watermark's resilience against a comprehensive suite of attacks designed to simulate real-world image manipulations. This analysis reveals a complex performance profile characterised by exceptional strength against signal processing attacks but catastrophic vulnerability to geometric transformations.

\subsection{Signal Processing Robustness: Exceptional Performance}
\label{subsec:SignalProcessingRobustness}

The evaluation of signal processing attacks demonstrates Gaussian Shading's remarkable robustness against common image degradations. Figure \ref{fig:robustness_jpeg_noise} illustrates the watermark's resilience to two critical attack categories: \ac{JPEG} compression and additive Gaussian noise.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{assets/robustness_jpeg_noise.pdf}
    \caption{Exceptional robustness against signal processing attacks. Left: \ac{JPEG} compression robustness showing minimal degradation even at aggressive compression ratios. Right: Gaussian noise resilience demonstrating consistent performance across increasing noise levels. Both attack types show \ac{BER} values well below critical thresholds.}
    \label{fig:robustness_jpeg_noise}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{JPEG Compression Analysis}
The \ac{JPEG} compression results reveal extraordinary robustness across the entire tested range. Even under severe compression (quality factor 25), the \ac{BER} remains at a mere 0.0135 (1.35%), far below the established robustness threshold of 0.1 for moderate attacks. This performance is particularly noteworthy given that \ac{JPEG} compression is among the most common image processing operations encountered in practice.

The compression robustness can be attributed to Gaussian Shading's distribution-preserving sampling mechanism, which embeds watermark information in a way that aligns with the natural redundancy structure of images. By operating in the latent space and preserving statistical properties, the method achieves resilience against compression artifacts that typically target high-frequency components.

\subsubsection{Noise Resilience}
Similarly impressive results emerge from the Gaussian noise evaluation. The watermark maintains excellent detectability even under significant noise contamination ($\sigma = 0.05$), with \ac{BER} reaching only 0.0069 (0.69%). This robustness demonstrates that the spatial redundancy created by the watermark diffusion process effectively withstands random perturbations.

The noise resilience is particularly important for real-world applications where images may undergo various forms of degradation during transmission, storage, or processing. The consistent performance across noise levels suggests that the watermark's error correction mechanisms and spatial redundancy provide effective protection against stochastic attacks.

\subsection{Additional Signal Processing Attacks}
\label{subsec:AdditionalSignalProcessing}

Beyond compression and noise, the evaluation encompasses additional signal processing attacks that further demonstrate the method's robustness. Gaussian blur attacks with radii up to 4 pixels result in \ac{BER} values of only 0.0180 (1.8%), while brightness adjustments spanning a factor-of-four range (0.5× to 2.0×) yield negligible degradation with maximum \ac{BER} of 0.0023 (0.23%).

These results collectively establish Gaussian Shading as exceptionally robust against the broad category of signal processing attacks, positioning it favourably compared to traditional watermarking methods that often struggle with such comprehensive attack resistance.

\subsection{Geometric Attack Vulnerability: A Critical Limitation}
\label{subsec:GeometricVulnerability}

In stark contrast to its exceptional signal processing robustness, the geometric attack evaluation reveals a fundamental vulnerability that significantly limits the method's practical applicability. Figure \ref{fig:robustness_blur_crop} starkly illustrates this limitation through the catastrophic failure under random crop attacks.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{assets/robustness_blur_crop.pdf}
    \caption{Contrasting robustness performance revealing critical vulnerability. Left: Continued excellent performance against Gaussian blur. Right: Comparative analysis highlighting the catastrophic failure under crop attacks (red bar) versus maintained robustness against other severe signal processing attacks.}
    \label{fig:robustness_blur_crop}
\end{figure}

The random crop attack, which removes 20\% of the image area before resizing, results in a devastating \ac{BER} of 0.4852 (48.52%)—essentially equivalent to random guessing (50%). This performance represents complete watermark destruction, indicating that the spatial redundancy mechanisms are insufficient to survive significant data loss.

\subsubsection{Root Cause Analysis}
The catastrophic crop failure stems from fundamental limitations in Gaussian Shading's spatial redundancy strategy:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Insufficient Spatial Distribution:} While the watermark is diffused across spatial dimensions, the redundancy level is insufficient to survive substantial spatial data loss.
    
    \item \textbf{Lack of Geometric Invariance:} The method lacks inherent geometric invariance properties, making it vulnerable to any transformation that significantly alters spatial relationships.
    
    \item \textbf{No Error Correction Integration:} The absence of sophisticated error correction codes limits recovery capability when portions of the watermark are lost.
\end{enumerate}

This vulnerability has profound practical implications, as cropping is among the most common image manipulations encountered in real-world scenarios, from social media posting to document processing.

\subsection{Comprehensive Robustness Summary}
\label{subsec:RobustnessOverview}

Table \ref{tab:comprehensive_robustness} provides a complete overview of the robustness evaluation results, clearly delineating the method's strengths and limitations.

\begin{table}[htb]
    \caption{Comprehensive Robustness Evaluation Results}
    \label{tab:comprehensive_robustness}
    \begin{center}
    \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Attack Category} & \textbf{Attack Configuration} & \textbf{Mean \ac{BER}} & \textbf{Performance} & \textbf{Assessment} \\ \hline
    \multirow{4}{*}{JPEG Compression} & Quality=90 & 0.0017 & Excellent & \textbf{Pass} \\
     & Quality=75 & 0.0028 & Excellent & \textbf{Pass} \\
     & Quality=50 & 0.0050 & Excellent & \textbf{Pass} \\
     & Quality=25 & 0.0135 & Very Good & \textbf{Pass} \\ \hline
    \multirow{3}{*}{Gaussian Noise} & $\sigma=0.01$ & 0.0015 & Excellent & \textbf{Pass} \\
     & $\sigma=0.03$ & 0.0037 & Excellent & \textbf{Pass} \\
     & $\sigma=0.05$ & 0.0069 & Excellent & \textbf{Pass} \\ \hline
    \multirow{2}{*}{Gaussian Blur} & Radius=2 & 0.0017 & Excellent & \textbf{Pass} \\
     & Radius=4 & 0.0180 & Very Good & \textbf{Pass} \\ \hline
    \multirow{2}{*}{Brightness} & Factor=0.5 & 0.0006 & Excellent & \textbf{Pass} \\
     & Factor=2.0 & 0.0023 & Excellent & \textbf{Pass} \\ \hline
    \textbf{Geometric} & \textbf{Crop (80\% retention)} & \textbf{0.4852} & \textbf{Catastrophic} & \textbf{Critical Fail} \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}%
    }
    \end{center}
\end{table}

The results reveal a clear performance dichotomy: exceptional robustness against signal processing attacks coupled with fundamental vulnerability to geometric transformations. This profile suggests that Gaussian Shading is well-suited for applications where signal processing attacks are the primary concern but may require additional protection mechanisms for scenarios involving geometric manipulations.

\section{Evaluation Scale and Methodology}
\label{sec:EvaluationScale}

The robustness evaluation was based on 200 images per attack configuration totaling 2,400 individual experiments, providing a substantial dataset for analysis. The imperceptibility assessment was conducted on 1,000 image pairs for the \ac{FID} calculation and \ac{CLIP} score comparison.

The comprehensive nature of the evaluation, spanning multiple attack types and intensities, enables reliable conclusions about the method's performance characteristics across different scenarios. The substantial sample sizes help ensure that the observed performance patterns are representative rather than artifacts of limited testing.

\section{Comparative Contextualisation}
\label{sec:ComparativeContext}

When positioned within the broader landscape of \ac{AI} watermarking techniques, Gaussian Shading's performance profile reveals both distinctive advantages and notable limitations. Compared to Stable Signature's requirement for model fine-tuning, Gaussian Shading's training-free nature represents a significant practical advantage, enabling rapid deployment across existing infrastructure without retraining costs.

Against Tree-Ring's 1-bit capacity limitation, Gaussian Shading's 256-bit payload capability provides substantial advantages for attribution and traceability applications. However, this capacity comes at the cost of the geometric vulnerability identified in this evaluation.

The distributional impact revealed through \ac{FID} analysis positions Gaussian Shading between truly lossless methods and those with more pronounced quality degradation. This intermediate position reflects the fundamental trade-offs inherent in watermarking system design.

\section{Key Research Questions: Empirical Answers}
\label{sec:ResearchAnswers}

The comprehensive evaluation provides definitive empirical answers to the study's fundamental research questions:

\textbf{Research Question 1: Robustness Extent}
Gaussian Shading demonstrates exceptional robustness against signal processing attacks, with \ac{BER} consistently below 2\% even under severe conditions. However, it exhibits catastrophic vulnerability to geometric attacks, particularly cropping, where performance degrades to random-chance levels.

\textbf{Research Question 2: Performance-Quality Trade-offs}
The method achieves visual and semantic imperceptibility, confirming its claims at the perceptual level. However, distributional analysis reveals measurable impact on the generative model's statistical properties, challenging absolute "performance-lossless" claims.

\textbf{Research Question 3: Competitive Positioning}
Gaussian Shading offers unique advantages in training-free deployment and high capacity, but these benefits come with the trade-off of geometric vulnerability and measurable distributional impact. The method occupies a distinct niche in the watermarking landscape, optimised for specific use cases rather than universal application.

\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{cha:conclusion}

This dissertation has conducted a comprehensive, independent evaluation of the Gaussian Shading watermarking technique for \ac{AI}-generated images, providing critical empirical insights into its performance characteristics and practical viability. Through rigorous implementation within a Stable Diffusion v2.1 framework and systematic evaluation against established benchmarks, this research contributes significant findings to the emerging field of \ac{AI} watermarking and challenges several fundamental assumptions about "performance-lossless" techniques.

\section{Synthesis of Key Findings}
\label{sec:SynthesisFindings}

The empirical evaluation has revealed a complex performance profile that defies simple categorisation. Gaussian Shading emerges as a technique with exceptional strengths in specific domains but critical vulnerabilities that limit its universal applicability. The findings can be synthesised into three fundamental insights that address the core research questions and extend beyond the original scope of investigation.

\subsection{The Imperceptibility Paradox}
The evaluation has uncovered what can be termed an "imperceptibility paradox"—the coexistence of excellent perceptual imperceptibility with measurable distributional impact. While individual watermarked images are visually and semantically indistinguishable from their non-watermarked counterparts, the aggregate statistical properties of the generated image distribution show significant alteration (FID score of 47.83 vs. threshold of 5.0).

This finding has profound implications for understanding what constitutes "performance-lossless" watermarking. The results suggest that imperceptibility operates at multiple levels—perceptual, semantic, and distributional—and that excellence at one level does not guarantee excellence at others. This multi-dimensional nature of imperceptibility challenges the binary notion of "lossless" watermarking and suggests the need for more nuanced evaluation frameworks.

\subsection{The Robustness Dichotomy}
The robustness evaluation has revealed a stark performance dichotomy that fundamentally shapes the method's practical applicability. Gaussian Shading demonstrates exceptional resilience against signal processing attacks—achieving BER values consistently below 2\% even under severe conditions—while exhibiting catastrophic vulnerability to geometric transformations, particularly cropping attacks where performance degrades to random-chance levels.

This dichotomy reflects fundamental design choices in the Gaussian Shading algorithm. The distribution-preserving sampling mechanism excels at maintaining watermark integrity under attacks that preserve spatial relationships but fails when spatial data is lost or significantly restructured. This limitation is not merely a matter of parameter optimisation but represents a fundamental architectural constraint.

\subsection{The Training-Free Trade-off}
The evaluation has illuminated the specific costs associated with Gaussian Shading's training-free advantage. While the method enables rapid deployment without model fine-tuning—a significant practical benefit—this convenience comes at the expense of deep integration and geometric robustness. The comparison with methods like Stable Signature, which require fine-tuning but achieve more robust integration, highlights the fundamental trade-offs inherent in watermarking system design.

\section{Research Questions: Definitive Answers}
\label{sec:DefinitiveAnswers}

The comprehensive evaluation provides definitive empirical answers to the study's fundamental research questions, supported by rigorous statistical analysis across 3,400 individual experiments.

\textbf{Research Question 1: To what extent can Gaussian Shading provide robust watermarking against standard digital attacks?}

Gaussian Shading provides exceptional robustness against signal processing attacks, with mean BER values consistently below 1.5\% for mild attacks and below 2\% even under severe conditions such as JPEG compression at quality factor 25 or Gaussian noise with $\sigma = 0.05$. However, the method exhibits a critical vulnerability to geometric attacks, particularly cropping, where robustness fails catastrophically (BER $\approx$ 48.5\%, equivalent to random guessing). This performance profile positions Gaussian Shading as highly effective for scenarios where signal processing is the primary threat but unsuitable for applications requiring geometric robustness.

\textbf{Research Question 2: What is the trade-off between watermark robustness and image quality?}

The evaluation reveals a complex trade-off structure that operates differently at various analytical levels. At the perceptual level, the trade-off is exceptionally favourable—the watermark achieves complete visual imperceptibility with no degradation in semantic content (CLIP score difference of 0.0008, well within measurement noise). However, at the distributional level, the trade-off is more costly, with measurable impact on the statistical properties of the generated image distribution (FID score of 47.83). This finding challenges the binary notion of "performance-lossless" watermarking and suggests that quality preservation is multi-dimensional.

\textbf{Research Question 3: How does Gaussian Shading's performance compare to other leading in-generation watermarking techniques?}

Gaussian Shading occupies a unique position in the watermarking landscape, offering distinctive advantages and trade-offs compared to competing methods. Its training-free nature provides significant deployment advantages over methods like Stable Signature, while its 256-bit capacity substantially exceeds Tree-Ring's 1-bit limitation. However, these benefits come at the cost of geometric vulnerability and distributional impact, positioning Gaussian Shading as optimised for specific use cases rather than universal application.

\section{Novel Contributions to the Field}
\label{sec:NovelContributions}

This research makes several significant contributions to the field of \ac{AI} watermarking and digital media authentication:

\subsection{Empirical Challenge to "Performance-Lossless" Claims}
This study provides the first rigorous empirical challenge to absolute "performance-lossless" claims in \ac{AI} watermarking literature. By demonstrating the coexistence of perceptual imperceptibility with distributional impact, the research establishes the need for multi-dimensional imperceptibility evaluation frameworks and more precise terminology in watermarking performance claims.

\subsection{Comprehensive Geometric Vulnerability Analysis}
The identification and quantification of Gaussian Shading's geometric vulnerability provides critical insights for both academic understanding and practical deployment decisions. The research establishes that training-free latent space methods may inherently struggle with geometric attacks, informing future algorithmic development priorities.

\subsection{Statistical Rigor in Watermarking Evaluation}
The evaluation methodology demonstrates enhanced statistical rigor through comprehensive confidence interval analysis, significance testing, and performance consistency evaluation across diverse image content. This approach establishes a benchmark for future watermarking evaluation studies.

\subsection{Practical Deployment Insights}
The research provides actionable insights for practical watermarking deployment, clearly delineating scenarios where Gaussian Shading excels (signal processing attack environments) and where it fails (geometric attack scenarios). These insights enable informed technology selection decisions in real-world applications.

\section{Limitations and Methodological Constraints}
\label{sec:LimitationsConstraints}

While this evaluation provides significant insights, several limitations constrain the generalisability and scope of the findings:

\subsection{Single-Model Evaluation}
The evaluation is limited to Stable Diffusion v2.1, constraining the generalisability of findings to other \ac{LDM} architectures or generative models. Different model architectures may interact differently with the Gaussian Shading watermarking mechanism, potentially yielding different performance characteristics.

\subsection{Attack Suite Limitations}
The attack suite, while comprehensive within its scope, does not include sophisticated adversarial attacks specifically designed to target and remove watermarks. Advanced adversarial techniques or attacks informed by knowledge of the watermarking algorithm might reveal additional vulnerabilities not captured in this evaluation.

\subsection{Scale Constraints}
Hardware limitations necessitated evaluation on 1,000 images for FID calculation compared to the original paper's 5,000 images. This scale difference may contribute to the elevated FID score through reduced statistical stability, though the core finding of distributional impact remains valid.

\subsection{Temporal and Environmental Factors}
The evaluation represents a snapshot assessment under controlled conditions and does not account for long-term robustness or performance variation under different computational environments or model versions.

\section{Implications for Responsible AI Development}
\label{sec:ResponsibleAI}

The findings of this research have significant implications for the broader development of responsible \ac{AI} systems, particularly in the context of synthetic media generation and digital content authenticity:

\subsection{Policy and Regulation Considerations}
The identification of specific strengths and limitations in Gaussian Shading provides crucial input for policy makers developing regulations around \ac{AI}-generated content. The research demonstrates that current watermarking techniques, while promising, have specific limitations that must be considered when mandating their use for synthetic media identification.

\section{Final Reflections}
\label{sec:FinalReflections}

This comprehensive evaluation of Gaussian Shading represents more than an assessment of a single watermarking technique—it illustrates the complexity and nuance inherent in \ac{AI} watermarking technology and the critical importance of rigorous empirical evaluation in an era of rapid technological development.

The findings challenge simplistic narratives about "perfect" or "lossless" watermarking solutions, demonstrating instead that effective watermarking involves complex trade-offs that must be carefully understood and managed. The research underscores that the path toward effective \ac{AI} content authentication requires not just algorithmic innovation but also sophisticated evaluation methodologies and honest assessment of limitations.

As the field of \ac{AI} watermarking continues to evolve, this research contributes to a foundation of rigorous empirical analysis that can guide both technological development and deployment decisions. The insights generated extend beyond Gaussian Shading itself to inform broader understanding of watermarking trade-offs, evaluation methodologies, and the multi-dimensional nature of imperceptibility.

The ultimate goal of this research is not merely to evaluate a specific technique but to contribute to the development of reliable, effective watermarking systems that can support the responsible development and deployment of \ac{AI}-generated media. In this context, the identification of both strengths and critical limitations represents not failure but essential progress toward more effective solutions.

Through rigorous evaluation and honest assessment of limitations, the research community can work towards developing watermarking systems that truly meet the complex demands of an era where synthetic media plays an increasingly important role in digital communication and content creation. This dissertation represents one step in that essential journey, providing both specific insights about Gaussian Shading and broader methodological contributions to the field of \ac{AI} watermarking evaluation.
