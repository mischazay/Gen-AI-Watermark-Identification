\section*{Ethical Considerations Checklist and Declaration}

\subsection*{Project Description}
\textit{Briefly explain the methodology of your study. Give sufficient detail that a non-expert in the subject can understand what you are proposing to do.}

\noindent
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|}
\hline
Identifying images generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI) with invisible watermarks: This can help improve copyright protections, traceability, and accountability. A watermarking method will be implemented to embed and retrieve these imperceptible watermarks with minimal compromise to quality. The method will be evaluated against its resistance to common attacks such as compression, cropping, noise, and smoothing. Additionally the chosen method will be compared with existing methods. \\

\end{tabularx}

\subsection*{External Datasets}
\textit{If you are using external datasets, please (a) identify the dataset(s) giving sufficient details; (b) identify the relevant licence or terms of use for the dataset(s) and justify why your project would be compliant with those terms; (c) if the data is about humans, also provide evidence that the data was initially collected with consent.}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|}
\hline
The project will make use of text-to-image prompt datasets in order to have standardisation of generated images COCO-2017 (CC BY-SA 4.0), Meaning attribution is required. The project will be compliant with the terms as no changes are being made and the datasets used will be credited and referenced Gustavosta prompt set. \\

\subsection*{Potential Ethical Issues}
\textit{Does your project involve any of the following? Please mark Yes or No for \textbf{all} issues.}

\noindent
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Issue} & \textbf{Yes / No} \\
\hline
Human participants (adults or children) & No \\
\hline
Human data (e.g. data collected through surveys and questionnaires on issues such as lifestyle, housing and working environments, or attitudes and preferences, or datasets including human data) & No \\
\hline
Datasets that require permission from the data provider & No \\
\hline
Applications that could potentially involve unethical practice, including potential dual-use applications (e.g. projects involving tools or data that can be used for unethical purposes e.g. to attack systems) & No \\
\hline
Funding sources or collaboration with potential to adversely affect existing relationships or bring the University or Department into disrepute (e.g. projects related to gambling, dark market, etc.) & No \\
\hline
Restrictions on dissemination (e.g. not being allowed to publish certain datasets or results) & No \\
\hline
Military or defence context & No \\
\hline
Overseas countries under regimes with poor human rights record or identified as dangerous by the Foreign \& Commonwealth Office & No \\
\hline
Human material (e.g. tissue or fluid samples), vertebrates, especially mammals and birds, or any other organisms not previously mentioned & No \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}

\vspace{1em}
\noindent
\textit{If you answered \textbf{No} to all the above, you do not need ethical approval.}

\vspace{1em}
\noindent
\textit{If you answered \textbf{Yes} to any of the above, you must complete a Fast-Track Ethical Approval Form, get it signed off by your project advisor, and submit it for approval to the Departmental Ethics Officers.}

\subsection*{Student Declaration}
\textit{I have considered the ethical implications of this project, all the terms and conditions and permissions of any datasets being used, and I have identified no significant ethical implications requiring an ethical approval application.}
