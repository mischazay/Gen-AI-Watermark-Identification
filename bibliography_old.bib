GPT-2 (ref. 1), GPT-3(.5) (ref. 2) and GPT-4 (ref. 3) demonstrated high performance across a variety of language tasks. ChatGPT introduced such language models to the public. It is now clear that generative artificial intelligence (AI) such as large language models (LLMs) is here to stay and will substantially change the ecosystem of online text and images. Here we consider what may happen to GPT-\{n\} once LLMs contribute much of the text found online. We find that indiscriminate use of model-generated content in training causes irreversible defects in the resulting models, in which tails of the original content distribution disappear. We refer to this effect as ‘model collapse’ and show that it can occur in LLMs as well as in variational autoencoders (VAEs) and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We build theoretical intuition behind the phenomenon and portray its ubiquity among all learned generative models. We demonstrate that it must be taken seriously if we are to sustain the benefits of training from large-scale data scraped from the web. Indeed, the value of data collected about genuine human interactions with systems will be increasingly valuable in the presence of LLM-generated content in data crawled from the Internet.},

	abstract = {In this article, a new scheme based on a combination of DWT, DCT, and SVD domains is presented, in which the main focus is to provide proper solutions for reducing effect of geometric attacks. To address this goal, we divide host image into four nonoverlapping rectangular segments called sub-images and then watermark is independently embedded into each of them, using the hybrid scheme. The redundancy reduces effect of cropping attack. Moreover, in order to correct main geometric attacks, such as rotation, translation, and affine translation, we propose an inventional synchronization technique to recover geometrically attacked image via detection of desired image corners. A binary image in the first experiment and some 1D binary random sequences with different lengths in the next experiments are used as watermarks. Since the studied binary sequences have generally smaller lengths than the capacity offered by the proposed scheme, we are motivated to utilize error correction techniques, such as data replication and hamming code for them. Achieved results, compared with other geometric robust schemes, shows that the proposed scheme has stronger or comparable robustness against common signal processing and geometric attacks.}

	abstract = {Generative image modeling enables a wide range of applications but raises ethical concerns about responsible deployment. This paper introduces an active strategy combining image watermarking and Latent Diffusion Models. The goal is for all generated images to conceal an invisible watermark allowing for future detection and/or identification. The method quickly fine-tunes the latent decoder of the image generator, conditioned on a binary signature. A pre-trained watermark extractor recovers the hidden signature from any generated image and a statistical test then determines whether it comes from the generative model. We evaluate the invisibility and robustness of the watermarks on a variety of generation tasks, showing that Stable Signature works even after the images are modified. For instance, it detects the origin of an image generated from a text prompt, then cropped to keep \$10{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the content, with \$90\$+\${\textbackslash}\%\$ accuracy at a false positive rate below 10\${\textasciicircum}\{-6\}\$.},
