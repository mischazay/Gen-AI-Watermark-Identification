# Identifying Images Generated by AI using Watermarks

BSc Computer Science Dissertation - University of York, 2025

My final year project evaluating **Gaussian Shading**, a training-free watermarking technique for Latent Diffusion Models that embeds imperceptible watermarks directly into the image generation process. The goal was to independently assess whether its performance-lossless claims hold up under a rigorous evaluation framework.

I implemented the algorithm on Stable Diffusion v2.1 and tested imperceptibility using FID and CLIP scores across 1000 images (MS-COCO), and robustness against 12 attack configurations across 200 images (Gustavosta prompts), 2400 experiments in total with full statistical analysis including 95% confidence intervals, ANOVA, and paired t-tests.

The results showed strong robustness against signal processing attacks, with TPR consistently above 98% even under severe JPEG compression (QF 25) and Gaussian blur. However, a clear vulnerability to geometric attacks was found, with a random crop retaining 80% of the image reducing TPR to 51.48%, statistically indistinguishable from random chance.
